# Job Portal
This is a job portal project developed using Django. In this project, we have to incorporate multiple recruiters and multiple job seekers from different domains on one platform. A single recruiter can post multiple job openings using his/her account. A single job seeker can apply for multiple openings based on his skills.
Both recruiters and job seekers are able to manage their accounts using a profile manager.
